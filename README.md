# ci-slack-responses
## The dream
It can be rough being a developer. There is endless work to be done, and endless more you'd wish you get back to doing. There's always another customer, feature or bug that needs to be fixed. However, we don't complain. It's fine. It's just how it is. At my currenty job (aka 2019) one of my systems is a testing system. It is a very cute testing system - basically doing integration tests and stuff.

Don't mind that.

The important part is that I got to customize what kind of output it would send slack. Being on a closed network I can't do too much fun, but I can embedd a tiny little script which can give me a fun response when tests fail.

This is that script.

Enjoy. I know I will.
